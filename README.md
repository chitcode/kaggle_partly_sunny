===================

Code for kaggle Partly Sunny competition

My initial benchmark code was based on the code shared by Abhishek <a href = http://www.kaggle.com/c/stumbleupon/forums/t/5680/beating-the-benchmark-leaderboard-auc-0-878/30315#post30315>here</a>

It fetched me something 0.16228 on public leader board.

Then gradually tuned different parameters of TF-IDF and ensembled with SGD. 
My final score is <b>0.15443</b> on public board and <b>0.15501</b> on private leader board.
